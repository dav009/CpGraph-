CpGraph-
========

CP(Graph) is Constraint Programming Graph Framework for Gecode (Currently under update).
Originally implemented by Gregoire Dooms for his phd [ http://cpgraph.info.ucl.ac.be/ ],  and then  update for Gecode 3.1 by David Przybilla.
Addionally extra elements were added so that all the propagators support incremental propagation.

This version is still unstable and under update ;) be noticed about changes soon.
