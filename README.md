CpGraph-
========

CP(Graph) is Constraint Programming Graph Framework for Gecode (Currently under update).
Originally implemented by Gregoire Dooms for his phd [ http://cpgraph.info.ucl.ac.be/ ],  and then  updated for Gecode 3.1 by David Przybilla.
where extra elements were added so that many of the propagators support incremental propagation.

This version is still unstable and under update ;) be noticed about changes soon.
